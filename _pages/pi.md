### About Me
I have always been passionate about computing. Many subfields of computing have gained and lost traction but HPC has always a been of interest and always will be. Demand will always exceed supply and computing is a limited resource.

### Family
Born in Vadodara, India,  I  am born in a family of 4 people. My mother and father have their businesses which my sister has taken over after her graduation.

### Hobbies
I like video games, books, listening to music and hiking.
