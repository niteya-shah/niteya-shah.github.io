## EXPERIENCE

Graduate Researcher August 2021-Present

SyNeRGy Lab and SEEC Center

Supervisor: Dr Wu Feng

Userspace Paging Optimization

- Study the effect of tuning paging parameters on applications with different characteristics using UMAP
- Identify optimal paging parameters in the user space using autotuning.


#### Global Analysis of Quantum Chromodynamics(QCD)

- Profile QCD carpentry code to find critical sections and linearization points.
- Improve performance of code by parallelization, optimization, and refactoring leading to a two-fold speedup.

#### Data Scientist May 2020 - July 2021

#### Tiger Digital Advertising, Vadodara

- Analysed data to gain insights, and learn patterns and trends.
- Tested products for market feasibility and identify customer bases with exploratory campaigns by using data
driven decisions.
- Translated research to standard operating procedures and create associated documentation for others to follow
and extend.

## INTERNSHIPS

#### DevOps Engineering Intern May 2019 - July 2019

#### Tiger Digital Advertising, Vadodara

- Executed automated desktop deployments.
- Performed ongoing performance tuning, hardware upgrades, and resource optimization.
- Monitored performance of system architecture, storage methods, and management system software leading to
modifications and adjustments.


## OPEN SOURCE CONTRIBUTIONS

- Contributor to CuPy, an A NumPy-compatible matrix library accelerated by CUDA

## PROJECTS

#### Face Recognition using Map Locking Winter 2019
#### Undergrad Thesis
#### Supervisor : Dr. Kannan A, Vellore Institute of Technology

- Designed and developed a custom loss function that better extracted information from the final feature
representation
- Cleaned and pre-processed the VGGFace2 dataset with 3.3 million images
- Designed a model architecture based on MobileNet and trained the model using both offline and online learning
- Achieved an accuracy of 98.7% on the test segment


#### Fluid Simulation using CUDA Fall 2019

- Designed and developed a fluid simulation engine using Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics, accelerated by
CUDA.
- Achieved a 40-fold speedup over a serial implementation.
- Engine can simulate 10 million particles in real time and show results via matplotlib.

#### Survey of Load-Balancing Algorithms used in Geometric Space Fall 2019

- Performed extensive review of Multi-Jagged, RCB and RIB load-balancing algorithms in the Zoltan package
which is a part of the Trilinos project.
- Compared the performance improvements and error growth caused by spatially partitioning the datasets using
the algorithms.


#### Gujarati Speech Recognition Winter 2018

- Developed a speech-to-text model for the Gujarati Language.
- The model architecture was composed of bidirectional gated recurrent units and used connectionist temporal
classification to estimate correctness and was trained on the Microsoft Speech Recognition Dataset.
- The model achieved 85% accuracy on the test segment.
